`I'm Hibernate Id Generators` is a handy and configurable set of custom identifier generators
for [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/) that can produce unique, sequential, or partitioned IDs
with support for cycling, time-based resets, and advanced strategies â€” all without you writing
complex boilerplate code, by simply annotating your entities.
